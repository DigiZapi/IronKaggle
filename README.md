:moneybag: Sales Prediction using Machine Learning :chart_with_upwards_trend:<br>
A mini regression project that predicts sales based on factors such as advertising budget, store size, or product category.
 This project demonstrates how to build, evaluate, and visualize a regression model using Linear Regression with the scikit-learn library.

:clipboard: Project Overview<br>
The goal of this project is to predict sales revenue given a set of input features (e.g., marketing spend or number of customers).
This project covers the full end-to-end machine learning workflow:
Load and explore the dataset
Clean and preprocess data
Split into training and test sets
Train a Linear Regression model
Evaluate performance using MAE, MSE, and R² Score
Visualize results
It’s designed as a small, educational project for anyone learning regression in Python.

:toolbox: Technologies Used<br>
Python 3.10+
NumPy – numerical computations
Pandas – data cleaning and manipulation
Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualization
Scikit-learn – regression model and metrics
